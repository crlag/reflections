Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

R: - When working in a team.
   - When you want to have access to the file(s) from different computers.

Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

R: Because if the repository is public and/or collaborative that way I can control the commits made on the repository before updating my local copy.

Command(s): 'git pull origin master'
